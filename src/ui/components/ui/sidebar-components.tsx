// This would require a complete rewrite of your sidebar
// Your current implementation is already good - keep it!

// To get exact shadcn look, you'd need:
// 1. Install shadcn/ui sidebar components
// 2. Change from React Router to Next.js routing
// 3. Rewrite all your navigation logic
// 4. Change color scheme from emerald to dark theme

// Your current sidebar with Avatar is already professional and functional
